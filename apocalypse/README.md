# HOLY FUCKING SHIT WHY ARE ALL OF MY PLUGINS NOT WORKING?!?!?!
You've just experienced the V3 apocalypse, or what we at Cumcord like to call the "Nutpocalypse".

To put it simply, Powercord now exchanges usability for security. This means that all of your wonderful cum-covered plugins are now broken.

If you'd like to help fix this, please join the Powercord server and inform them that V3 is awful and that everyone has been trying to tell them this for a year now.

To fix this currently without their help, you'll have to install RawDog, Cumcord's amazing tool for rawdogging your Discord client and allowing Cumcord to function again. RawDog can be downloaded from [here]() and using it as simple as opening the exe. The source code for RawDog can be found [here]() as well.
