## What is Cumcord? <!-- {docsify-ignore-all} -->
Cumcord is a Discord client modification that allows you to interface with Discord's internals via plugins. Unlike other client mods, Cumcord works with all other Discord modifications out of the box and even encourages you to use them with Cumcord.

## Discord's API
Discord's desktop client has built in modules for doing various tasks within Discord (e.g sending a message, showing a modal, etc). Cumcord allows you to access these modules via plugins.

## But what is a plugin?
A plugin is code written in JavaScript that uses Cumcord's built-in API to interact with and extend the Discord client. Plugins are built in such a way that they can be toggled on and off at will.

## How do I write plugins?
That's what these docs are here for! A basic plugin building guide can be found [on this page](/plugin-guide/).
<!--
API DOCS ARE UNFINISHED SO FOR NOW: NO.
## I just want to know about the API.
If you just want to see what Cumcord can do, check out the [API docs](/api/).
